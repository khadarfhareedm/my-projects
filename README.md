created a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML part structures the calculator interface, defining buttons for numbers, operators, and functions like clear and equals. CSS adds styling to make the calculator visually appealing, with layout, colors, and responsive design. JavaScript handles the functionality, enabling calculations, button interactions, and updating the display based on user input. This combination of technologies results in a fully functional and interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations directly in the browser.
